############################# Server Basics #############################

# The id of the broker. This must be set to a unique integer for each broker.
broker.id=0

############################# Socket Server Settings #############################

# The port the socket server listens on
port=9092

# The number of threads handling network requests
num.network.threads=2

# The number of threads doing disk I/O
num.io.threads=2

# The send buffer (SO_SNDBUF) used by the socket server
socket.send.buffer.bytes=1048576

# The receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) used by the socket server
socket.receive.buffer.bytes=1048576

# The maximum size of a request that the socket server will accept (protection against OOM)
socket.request.max.bytes=104857600

controlled.shutdown.enable=false

############################# Log Basics #############################

# The directory under which to store log files
log.dir=/tmp/kafka-logs

# The number of logical partitions per topic per server. More partitions allow greater parallelism
# for consumption, but also mean more files.
num.partitions=1

############################# Log Flush Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the flush of data to disk. This is the most
# important performance knob in kafka.
# There are a few important trade-offs here:
#    1. Durability: Unflushed data is at greater risk of loss in the event of a crash.
#    2. Latency: Data is not made available to consumers until it is flushed (which adds latency).
#    3. Throughput: The flush is generally the most expensive operation.
# The settings below allow one to configure the flush policy to flush data after a period of time or
# every N messages (or both). This can be done globally and overridden on a per-topic basis.

# The number of messages to accept before forcing a flush of data to disk
log.flush.interval.messages=10000

# The maximum amount of time a message can sit in a log before we force a flush
log.flush.interval.ms=1000

############################# Log Retention Policy #############################

# The following configurations control the disposal of log segments. The policy can
# be set to delete segments after a period of time, or after a given size has accumulated.
# A segment will be deleted whenever *either* of these criteria are met. Deletion always happens
# from the end of the log.

# The minimum age of a log file to be eligible for deletion
log.retention.hours=168

# The maximum size of a log segment file. When this size is reached a new log segment will be created.
log.segment.bytes=536870912

############################# Zookeeper #############################

# Zookeeper connection string (see zookeeper docs for details).
# This is a comma separated host:port pairs, each corresponding to a zk
# server. e.g. "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002".
# You can also append an optional chroot string to the urls to specify the
# root directory for all kafka znodes.
zookeeper.connect=localhost:2181

# Timeout in ms for connecting to zookeeper
zookeeper.connection.timeout.ms=1000000
