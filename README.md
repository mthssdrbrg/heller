# Heller

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/heller.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthssdrbrg/heller)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/mthssdrbrg/heller/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/mthssdrbrg/heller?branch=master)

Heller is a JRuby wrapper around the Kafka Producer and (Simple)Consumer
APIs, much like [Mikka](https://github.com/iconara/mikka) is for Akka's Java API.

The goal of Heller is to make the Producer and Consumer APIs of Kafka a bit more
Rubyesque, and useful as building blocks for creating more advanced producer and
consumer implementations.

## Producer API

```Heller::Producer``` is an extremely simple wrapper class around
```kafka.javaapi.producer.Producer``` and provides some convenience in configuring the
producer with more Rubyesque names for configuration parameters.

All configuration parameters are supported and can be used in the following way:

```ruby
require 'heller'

producer = Heller::Producer.new('localhost:9092,localhost:9093', {
  :type => :async,
  :serializer => 'kafka.serializer.StringEncoder',
  :key_serializer => 'kafka.serializer.DefaultEncoder',
  :partitioner => 'kafka.producer.DefaultPartitioner',
  :compression => :gzip,
  :num_retries => 5,
  :retry_backoff => 1500,
  :metadata_refresh_interval => 5000,
  :batch_size => 2000,
  :client_id => 'spec-client',
  :request_timeout => 10000,
  :buffer_limit => 100 * 100,
  :buffer_timeout => 1000 * 100,
  :enqueue_timeout => 1000,
  :socket_buffer => 1024 * 1000,
  :ack => -1
})
```

Check the official [Kafka docs](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs) for possible values for each parameter.

To send messages you creates instances of ```Heller::Message``` and feed them to the
```#push``` method of the producer:

```ruby
messages = 3.times.map { Heller::Message.new('test', 'my message!') }
producer.push(messages)
```

Want to partition messages based on some key? Sure, no problem:

```ruby
messages = [0, 1, 2].map { |key| Heller::Message.new('test', "my message using #{key} as key!", key.to_s) }
producer.push(messages)
```

## Consumer API

```Heller::Consumer``` wraps ```kafka.javaapi.consumer.SimpleConsumer``` and provides
basically the same methods, but with a bit more convenience (or at least I'd
like to think so).

A ```Consumer``` can be created in the following way:

```ruby
require 'heller'

options = {
  # 'generic' consumer options
  :timeout => 5000,            # socket timeout
  :buffer_size => 128 * 1024,  # socket buffer size
  :client_id => 'my-consumer', # id of consumer
  # fetch request related options
  :max_wait => 4500,           # maximum time (ms) the consumer will wait for response of a request
  :min_bytes => 1024           # minimum amount of bytes the server (broker) should return for a fetch request
}

consumer = Heller::Consumer.new('localhost:9092', options)
```

The options specified in the options hash are also described in the official
[Kafka docs](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#consumerconfigs), albeit they're described in the context of their high-level
consumer.

The consumer API exposes the following methods: ```#fetch```, ```#metadata```,
```#offsets_before```, ```#earliest_offset``` and ```#latest_offset```, and
their usage is described below.

### Fetching messages

```ruby
topic = 'my-topic'
partition = offset = 0

response = consumer.fetch(Heller::FetchRequest.new(topic, partition, offset))

if response.error? && (error_code = response.error(topic, partition)) != 0
  puts "Got error #{Heller::Errors.error_for(error_code)}!"
else
  message_enumerator = response.messages(topic, partition)
  message_enumerator.each do |offset, message_payload|
    puts "#{offset}: #{message_payload}"
  end
end
```

See ```Heller::FetchResponse``` (and the related specs) for usage of other
methods.

It's also possible to pass an array of ```FetchRequest``` objects to ```#fetch```.

```ruby
requests = [0, 1, 2].map { |i| Heller::FetchRequest.new(topic, i, offset) }
fetch_response = consumer.fetch(requests)
```

### Topic and partition metadata

```kafka.javaapi.consumer.SimpleConsumer``` exposes a method called ```#topic_metadata```, which in Heller has been "renamed" to just ```#metadata```.

```ruby
topics = [1, 2, 3].map { |i| "my-topic-#{i}" }

response = consumer.metadata(topics)

response.each do |topic, partition_metadata|
  puts "Got metadata for (#{topic}:#{partition_metadata.partition_id})"
end

leader = response.leader_for('my-topic-1', 0)
puts "Leader for my-topic-1:0 is at #{leader.connection_string} (#{leader.zk_string})"

isrs = response.isr_for('my-topic-1', 0) # also aliased as #in_sync_replicas_for
isrs.each do |isr|
  puts "An in-sync replica for my-topic-1:0 is at #{isr.connection_string} (#{isr.zk_string})"
end
```

### Get offsets for topic-partition combinations

```ruby
# arguments = *[topic, partition, timestamp (ms), max number of offsets]
request = Heller::OffsetRequest.new('my-topic', 0, Time.now.to_i * 1000, 10)
response = consumer.offsets_before(request)

if response.error? && (error_code = response.error('my-topic', 0)) != 0
  puts "Got error #{Heller::Errors.error_for(error_code)}!"
else
  offsets = response.offsets('my-topic', 0)
  puts "Got #{offsets.join(', ')} offsets for my-topic:0"
end
```

```Heller::Consumer``` also exposes (as ```SimpleConsumer```) two convenience
methods for retrieving the earliest / latest offset for a topic-partition
combination.

```ruby
earliest_offset = consumer.earliest_offset('my-topic', 0)
latest_offset = consumer.latest_offset('my-topic', 0)

puts "Earliest available offset is #{earliest_offset}"
puts "Latest available offset is #{latest_offset}"
```

## Status

The project is currently under development, and I wouldn't really recommend it
to be used in any form of production environment.
There is still quite some work that needs to be done, especially for the Consumer API.
The Producer API is more or less done, for the moment at least.

It's getting there, though I'm mostly doing this during my spare time, which is
sparse at times.
